/*function rules
1) you only need parens () to build a function and to call a function
2) almost always you need {} around the fuhction body
3) usually, you should 'return' from a function
4) not all functions need to have names
A) function ideas: they are used for repeated chunks of code, but unlike loops, the repeats don't have to happen consecutively 
you need parameters in your functions when every time you use the function, it could run in a slightly different way */
